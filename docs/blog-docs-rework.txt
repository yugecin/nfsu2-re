{Docs rework} ||| h id=docsrework

Alright, finally after 2.5 months of on-off work, the rework/revamp of this
documentation website is done. Previously this website was just a single (huge)
page with a lot of text and symbol information in between, now that same
information is split between the {docs} and                                     ||| a href=docs.html
{functions}/{structs}/{enums}/{variables} pages.                                ||| a href=funcs.html,a href=structs.html,a href=enums.html,a href=vars.html
There's also this new 'blog' section, so I can put more 'discovering' style
content in here and keep the docs more clean and tidy and to-the-point.

{In the beginning I wrote the docs html manually}, which was fine for a while  ||| a class=ext href=https://github.com/yugecin/nfsu2-re/commit/7c18467184fe0d8a8ad13b6c320272320c80b897
but soon became a tedious job. I'm not a big fan of Markdown because it seems
like many places use a different dialect (the meaning for {__}/{**}/{*} may    ||| code,code,code
differ, for example on Slack and Discord) and certain elements (like links)
break the flow of the text in source form. So at some point I came up with an
idea for a markup language and {I made a first implementation of mmparse.c}.   ||| a class=ext href=https://github.com/yugecin/nfsu2-re/commit/3f93d854d0c045e0c937f41c628ebf6e20bdf7db
I named this 'margin markup' because the configuration of the presentation
would be put in the document's margin. It has its own problems of course (for
example you constantly need to reorder/copy the margin when editing lines) but
so far I think the positives outweigh the negatives.

That was better, but I still copied symbol information from my IDA database
into the docs manually. That means it could get outdated very easily,
information would be spread between the docs and the IDA database (because
usually I put function descriptions in the docs but not as comments in IDA)
and it is just an annoying chore to synchronize it all the time.

Then at some point I had the idea of just generating these docs based on the
IDA database. Since the IDA database is a binary file, which is undocumented
(I think), and may change between versions of IDA, I decided to use the
'dump database to IDC file' feature of IDA and parse that IDC file instead.
IDC is some kind of custom c-like scripting language, so I wrote a parser
for that ({docs/idcparse.c}).                                                  ||| hookfileref

After doing that, I moved all of the function/structure documentation into
comments in IDA, which now also get parsed using the 'margin markup' format
I made. Now I can write docs and blogposts and easily link to all of the
symbols, because they are written to their html pages and anchors are added
as needed.

Small example:

.pushmode pre
Here's a function {529B50} and variable {838454} struct {struct SmsData} and  \||| ref,ref,ref
enum {enum SMS_TYPE} with members {{struct SmsData+2} == {enum SMS_TYPE/0x4}} \||| ref,code,ref,ref
struct inner member and chained members {{struct Career.5D20.1404}}           \||| code,ref
with pointer {{struct SmsMessage.0.2}}                                        \||| code,ref
chained from variable of type struct {{838640.328}}                           \||| code,ref
chained from variable of type struct pointer {{8384C4.8.E4}}                  \||| code,ref
.popmode pre

Results in:

Here's a function {529B50} and variable {838454} struct {struct SmsData} and   ||| ref,ref,ref
enum {enum SMS_TYPE} with members {{struct SmsData+2} == {enum SMS_TYPE/0x4}}  ||| ref,code,ref,ref
struct inner member and chained members {{struct Career.5D20.1404}}            ||| code,ref
with pointer {{struct SmsMessage.0.2}}                                         ||| code,ref
chained from variable of type struct {{838640.328}}                            ||| code,ref
chained from variable of type struct pointer {{8384C4.8.E4}}                   ||| code,ref

.popmode section

When a struct or enum changes name now, I'll get an error while the docs are
being generated. That way the docs can't be too desynchronized anymore from
what I have in the IDA database. Function and variable name changes are free
because those are references by their addresses, so nothing in the docs source
needs to be updated for those.

Now I probably won't touch this project for a few months while I go back to
another project that I haven't touched in months :^)
